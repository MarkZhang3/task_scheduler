# Introduction:

Task Scheduler is a feature-rich web application built using Python Django that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks and events. This user-friendly tool provides a simple and intuitive interface to schedule, view, and edit tasks effortlessly. The application supports user authentication and includes additional features like email reminders for upcoming events and user profile management.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication System:**
   - Task Scheduler comes with a robust login/logout system to secure user data and ensure a personalized experience.
   - Users can also explore the app through the demo feature without creating a new account.

2. **Task Management:**
   - The main layout comprises a calendar and a sidebar, making it easy for users to organize their events and tasks.
   - The sidebar displays selected dates and the corresponding scheduled events.

3. **Profile Management:**
   - Users can access their profiles to make changes to their username, email, and password settings.
   - To enable email reminders for upcoming events, users can add an "App Password" for their email account, ensuring timely notifications.

4. **Automated Email Reminders:**
   - Task Scheduler integrates with `stmplib`, `ssl` libraries, and the `APScheduler` package to send automated email reminders.
   - Users can provide their email address and the app password to receive reminders about upcoming events, ensuring timely follow-ups.
   - In order to do this, the app needs the userâ€™s email and an app password which can be generated via [Google App Passwords](myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). Once you obtain an app password for your email, go to Profile to add the password.
